## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

### **Task 1 — Complete Data Analysis Report**
- Clean and analyze customer, campaign, and economic data  
- Identify key factors affecting customer subscription  
- Visualize distributions, correlations, outliers, and patterns  

### **Task 2 — Predictive Modeling**
- Handle class imbalance using **SMOTE**  
- Train 5 ML models (LR, DT, RF, XGBoost, LightGBM)  
- Compare recall, precision, F1, and AUC  
- Select the best model for customer prediction  

### **Task 3 — Business Recommendations**
- Provide actionable strategies for improving conversions  
- Recommend optimal campaign timing and customer targeting  
- Suggest best contact methods and call frequency

### **Dataset Includes:**
- Customer attributes (age, education, job, loans)  
- Contact method & call details  
- Campaign history  
- Macro-economic indicators  

---

## 🛠️ **Technologies & Libraries Used**

## 🔍 **Key EDA Insights**

### ✔ **Customer Behavior**
- Middle-aged customers (30–60) subscribe the most  
- Higher education & stable job roles show better engagement  

### ✔ **Contact Findings**
- Cellular contact performs far better than telephone  
- May, June, July are the strongest months  

### ✔ **Economic Impact**
- Lower interest rates (euribor3m) correlate with higher subscriptions  
- Strong correlations found among economic indicators  

### ✔ **Data Challenges**
- High imbalance (~11% YES)  
- Outliers in campaign counts & duration  
- Skewed features requiring log transformation

## 🎉 **Final Selected Model: XGBoost**

XGBoost provides the **best balance of recall and F1-score** for identifying potential subscribers, making it the most practical choice for real-world marketing campaigns.

---

## 💡 **Business Recommendations**

### ✔ **1. Target High-Probability Customers**
Use model predictions to focus on customers with higher subscription likelihood.

### ✔ **2. Prefer Mobile (Cellular) Calls**
Cellular communication shows far better conversion rates than telephone.

### ✔ **3. Limit Calls to 2–3 Attempts**
Avoid excessive calling; optimal follow-up is 2–3 attempts.

### ✔ **4. Leverage Previous Campaign Success**
Customers with successful past outcomes should be prioritized.

### ✔ **5. Time Campaigns Wisely**
Campaigns perform better during favorable economic conditions (e.g., low interest rates).

### ✔ **6. Improve Call Quality**
Longer, meaningful conversations increase the chance of subscription.
